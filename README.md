## Developing a reproducible Shiny app

Example Shiny application adopting the recommendations of "Ten Quick Tips for Developing a Reproducible Shiny Application", Brun et al, 2025, PLOS Computational Biology.

In this example, we are reusing the Faithful Shiny app example (<https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/start-simple/faithful/>) provided as part of the R `shiny` package. This Shiny application displays eruption data for the Old Faithful geyser.

Tips demonstrated:

-   Set up your computing environment
    -   Use git and GitHub
    -   Use `renv` to record package versions
    -   Record the output of `sessionInfo()`
-   Document and develop incrementally
    -   Comment UI elements
-   Make your Shiny application modular and portable
    -   Organize code and data
    -   Use relative paths and `file.path`
-   Preprocess and cache data for performance
    -   Cache remotely-accessed and processed data in a local file
-   Make underlying data accessible
    -   Cite the original data
-   License code and data appropriately
    -   Add a LICENSE file
    -   Respect the license of the original data
-   Make your data and source code citable
    -   Add a suggested citation to the README
    -   Add a CITATION.cff file
-   Share your app
    -   Publish on shinyapps.io and archive in Zenodo
